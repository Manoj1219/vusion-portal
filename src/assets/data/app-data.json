Retail supply chains are responsible for 25% of the world GHG emissions and many retailers have set bold targets towards the net zero race but only a few are on track with an actionable agenda. As a result, physical retail digitalization has an important role to play in the world’s sustainability agenda. Our solutions support putting stores at the heart of retailers’ e-commerce strategy by allowing in-store fulfillment, pickup, and express delivery, avoiding the construction of order-picking warehouses and by:<br>*Enabling local and low carbon e-commerce<br>*Reducing food waste<br>*Influencing responsible consumption at the shelf<br>*Fostering local-for-local production and consumption<br>*Enabling end-to-end supply chain transparency<br>*Paperless commerce</p>"

Thus, the Group is dedicated to fostering a positive experience at every key stage of the customer journey in order to set this virtuous cycle in motion. The indicator we used is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). It is a widely used tool for measuring customer loyalty and satisfaction. It involves asking customers how likely they are to recommend a product or service to others, on a scale of 0-10. Our customer satisfaction survey is deployed worldwide. It is linked to our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system and our Power BI analysis tool. Implementing NPS across the work done by every employee will help us measure how customers perceive our service and how well our business is doing. With an overall NPS above 65 in the first half of 2023 (compared to 55 in 2022 vs. 38 in 2021) and an industry average of around 33, VusionGroup is in the upper range of the SaaS and software sector and remains on a clear path towards improvement. This positive NPS has been achieved by adopting a truly customer-centric approach. "
