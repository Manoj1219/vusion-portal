              A cookie is a small piece of data (text file) that a website, when
              visited by a user, asks your browser to store on your device.
              Cookies have many purposes: they can be used to remember the
              language in which the web page is displayed, an identifier
              enabling your browsing to be tracked for statistical or
              advertising purposes, etc. Some of these purposes are strictly
              necessary for the functionalities expressly requested by the user
              or for establishing communication and are therefore exempted from
              consent. Others, which do not meet these criteria, require the
              user’s consent before being read or written.
